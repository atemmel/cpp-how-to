## Structs

A `struct` is a way to design your own type of data, by combining various other already existing datatypes. For instance, you might wish to represent a `Person` in some way. A `Person` could have a `firstName` and a `lastName` represented as `std::string`s, as well as an `age`, represented as an `Ã¬nt`. These different components are commonly called *members* of the `struct`. A `struct` designed like the description above would look like this in C++:

```cpp
struct Person 
{
	std::string firstName;
	std::string lastName;
	int age;
};
```

In order to use a `struct`, you may need to specify which one of the different members you wish to work with:
```cpp
Person person;
person.firstName = "James";
person.lastName = "Bond";
person.age = 37;

std::cout << "The name is " << person.lastName ". " << person.firstName << " " << person.lastName << std::endl;
```

Everything you can do with a regular type, you can also do with the `struct`s you design. This includes:

Returning it from a function:
```
Person createPerson();
```

Passing it into a function:
```
bool isAdult(Person person);
```

Creating an `std::vector` of `Person`s:
```
std::vector<Person> persons;
Person person;
person.firstName = "Victor";
persons.push_back(person);
```
